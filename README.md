*Please note due to the website was lauched on a free server on Render it does not work as expected. 
The server gets overloaded when you try to sign up.
Currently you can only access the homepage. 

### Description

The purpose of the website is where a user can save and create quotes.

When the user first lands on the homepage they will be greeted by a quote of the day. There is a navbar at the top of the screen where the user can sign up or log in. Under the quote of the day there is a mini navbar where the user can search for users. Next to it there is a tags button that when clicked will bring up all the tags. Then the user can click on a tag and see all the quotes that the tag is tagged.

When a user clicks the sign up link it'll take them to a sign in page in which they have to enter in their username, E-mail, and password. Optionally there are three separate inputs in which the user can put a favorite quote, author of the quote, and profile image URL. When a user clicks on the login link it'll take them to a login page in which they have to enter in a username and password. Afterwards the user will be redirected to the homepage. When a user is logged in the main navbar will have the new links Profile, New Quote, and Log Out.

The new quote link will take the user to a new quote page where they will be able to enter a quote and an author. There is also a tags selection where a user can add tags to their quote. After they submit their new quote they will be redirected to their profile.

The profile page has a user's info such as their favorite quote, their own quotes, the quotes they saved, the number of followers, and the number of people following them. As well as an edit info button which allows them to edit their info and delete their profile. The following and followers numbers are links to view the people that are followed or are following the user. If a person views another user they will be able to follow them and like the quotes that they saved or have saved.



### Features

The API I used was FavQs api to get the quote of the day.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python as the main coding languages.


Some of the features I implemented are a search bar to search for users, a show password button, and tags.
